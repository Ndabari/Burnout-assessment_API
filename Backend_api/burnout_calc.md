Defining specific thresholds for your scoring system involves determining what constitutes low, medium, and high levels of academic stress or burnout based on the total scores. Since we don't have specific data or a distribution for these questions, we'll use general guidelines

### Scoring System:
**Scale:** Use a Likert scale where respondents rate each question on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being "Strongly Disagree" and 5 being "Strongly Agree."

**Directionality:** Assigning a direction to each question based on whether a higher score indicates higher stress or burnout (E for Exhaustion, D for Disengagement).

> Example Scoring System:
>   1. Strongly Disagree
>   2. Disagree
>   3. Neutral
>   4. Agree
>   5. Strongly Agree

> Example Interpretation:
>
> Disengagement (D) Questions:
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Higher scores indicate higher levels of disengagement from academic activities. Sum the scores for these questions.
> Exhaustion (E) Questions:
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Higher scores indicate higher levels of exhaustion related to academic activities. Sum the scores for these questions.

>Total Score:
Total Score: Combine the scores from both Disengagement and Exhaustion questions. This total score can give you an overall measure of academic stress or burnout.
Interpretation:
Low Burnout/Stress: Total Score < Threshold
Medium Burnout/Stress: Threshold ≤ Total Score < 2 * Threshold
High Burnout/Stress: Total Score ≥ 2 * Threshold


### Steps to Calculate Standard Deviation:
#### 1. Calculate the Mean (Average):
- Add up all the individual scores and divide by the number of scores.
- Let's denote the mean as $X$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ X = {{\sum x} \over n} $$

- ${\sum x}$ is the sum of all individual scores.
- $n$ is the number of scores

#### 2. Calculate the Squared Differences:
- Subtract the mean $X$ from each individual score, square the result, and sum up all these squared differences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\sum(X_i - X)^2$

- $X_i$ represents each individual score.

#### 3. Calculate the Variance:
- Divide the sum of squared differences by the number of scores $n$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $Variance = {{\sum(X_i - X)^2} \over n}$

#### 4. Calculate the Standard Deviation:
- Take the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $Standard$ $Deviation$ $ = {\sqrt{Variance}}$
